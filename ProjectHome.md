This project is an incubator for Java components developed at Oxen Software Studio.

As long as each component grows, the could be separated into a new, independent project.

At the moment, in progress components include:
  * [Bean and Class Wrapper](Wrapper.md)
  * [MVP with Field-to-bean binding](Property.md)
  * [Simple Event Bus implementation](EventBus.md)
  * [Converter interface and implementations](Converter.md)
  * [Licensing module](License.md)

Maven is required to build.

You can find  details for each release [here](Releases.md).

Believe it or not, there are [people using](WhoIsUsingThis.md) these libraries!
