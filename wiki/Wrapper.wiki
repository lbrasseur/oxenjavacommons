#summary Wrapper documentation

= Introduction =
Documentation for Wrapper component.


= Details =
The `BeanWrapper` and `ClassWrapper` components allows wrapping of classes and objects in order to manipulate them in a dynamic way.

The implementation is hidden behind a `WrapperFactory`.

A simple implementation is provided. `Spring BeanWrapper` and `Commons BeanUtils` implementations could be easily built, but they wouldn't run on Android

= Ideas =
  * Provide a more sophisticated implementation with chained property access (using the dot operator in property names).
  * Provide `CommonsBeantils` and `Spring` implementations
